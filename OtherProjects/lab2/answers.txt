Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
- No because the two constructors have the same parameter type (String) and Java uses the number and type of arguments to differentiate between constructors. If two constructors have the same number and type of arguments (in this case only one type String parameter), Java will not be able to tell them apart.
